### Reflection

This exercise was very educational.  I had tinkered with SQL before but I had never really understood it as well as I wanted
to.  I know I am still well short of that knowledge but I feel like this was a very good start along that path.  I liked working 
through these sections and will continue with the rest of them when I get a chance to.  In the select quiz there seems to be
a problem missing so the best you could hope for is a 7/8 (because there were only 7 questions that I could find).
