## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

<!-- display your one-to-one image inline here -->
<!-- display your many-to-many image inline here -->

## Release 5: Reflection
This exercise was very beneficial.  I had worked with SQL previously but never had a great grasp of it due to lack of 
instruction but I think I have a basic understanding of the connections now and the ability to diagram a database.  
I struggled initially working on the SQL designer in socrates but think I have the hang of it now.
